# House-of-Renaissance
<!-- Personal Project -->

## Description 
Hey Bey, we are super excited that you decided to grace us, Charlotte NC, with YOUR presence marking this the 25th stop on the Renaissance World Tour. You hold a special place in our hearts so Chef Ray & I wanted to share our story with you. I’ve also built a cool “love” project to honor everything Renaissance. A google maps is provided with each concert stop pinned, you can view photos and videos specific to that location. You can quiz your knowledge on the album and tour. After you're done you can be redirected to purchase tickets, shop merch, or view the Queen's instagram. I hope you enjoy!
