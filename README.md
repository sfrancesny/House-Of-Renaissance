# House-of-Renaissance
<!-- Personal Project -->

## Description 
This is a “love” project to honor everything Renaissance. A google maps is provided with each concert stop pinned, you can view photos and videos specific to that location. You can quiz your knowledge on the album and tour. After you're done you can be redirected to purchase tickets (UPDATED tour has been completed, no more sale of tickets), shop merch, or view the Queen's instagram. I hope you enjoy!
